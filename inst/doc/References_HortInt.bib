addresses the fundamental meaning of statistical interaction and its
relationship to measurement scale, disproportionate sample sizes in the

 pages = {1--40},
 volume = {18},
 number = {1},
 journal = {Journal of Educational Statistics},
 abstract = {This article considers two related issues concerning the analysis of
interactions in complex linear models. The first issue concerns the
omnibus test for interaction. Apparently, it is not well known that the
usual F test for interaction can be replaced, in many applications, by a
test that is more powerful against a certain class of alternatives. The
competing test is based on the maximal product interaction contrast F
statistic and achieves its power advantage by focusing solely on product
contrasts. The maximal product interaction F test is reviewed and three
new results are reported: (a) An extended table of exact critical values
is computed, (b) a table of moment functions useful for approximating
the p-value corresponding to an observed maximal F statistic is
computed, and (c) a simulation study concerning the null distribution of
the maximal F statistic when data are unbalanced or covariates are
present is reported. It is conjectured that lack of balance or presence
of covariates has no effect on the null distribution. The simulation
results support the conjecture. The second issue concerns follow-up
tests when the omnibus test is significant. It appears that researchers,
in general, do not perform coherent follow-up tests on interactions. To
make it easier for researchers to do so, an exposition on the use of
product interaction contrasts and partial interactions in complex
fixed-effects models is provided. The recommended omnibus and follow-up
tests are illustrated on an educational data set analyzed using SAS (SAS
Institute, 1988) and SPSS (1990).}

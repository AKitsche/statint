Analysis of statistical interactions


The R add-on package statint provides the functions `iacontrast()` and `plotcontrast()`. In addition some data sets for the analysis of
statistical interactions are provided. An extensive demonstration of the functionality can be found in the package vignette. 
For a detailed description of the underlying methodology the authors refer to:
